                        This blender works amazingly, and blends within seconds.  The single serve cups also work really well for smoothies or protein shakes!

                        <h2>Very unhappy</h2>
                        Less than 2 months after purchase it completely stopped working. First it wouldn't detect the pitcher when trying to blend a significant amount, a couple weeks later it wouldn't detect the single serve cup.

                        Separating the men from the boys,  separating the amateurs from the professionals when it comes to blenders, when you revealed to us that, -It doesn&#x27;t pulverize seeds-.I really need a good blender, but there is No way that I would buy this blender now. Thank you so much, Jon

                        <h2>Very Disappointed</h2>
                        This blender is not superior to other smoothie blenders, It doesn't pulverize seeds and leaves green smoothies chunky with a lot of pulp. The single serve concept is amazing, however, my single serve cup began to break right from the start. The prongs became chipped because of the difficulty of screwing it in and out of the base. It won't blend for more than a minute without smelling like burned rubber. While the single serve seemed to blend more smoothly, it didn't hold much, especially when adding ice. I was very disappointed and so I returned it
